Torsion springs are usually more expensive ($250-$400) but last longer. Extension spring replacement costs $200-$300. Double car doors may cost $300-$500. We provide free estimates and upfront pricing with no hidden fees."},{question:"How do I know if my garage door spring is broken?",answer:"Signs of a broken garage door spring include: the door won't open or opens only a few inches, the door slams shut when you try to open it, you hear a loud bang or snapping noise, one side of the door is higher than the other, or the door feels much heavier than normal. You may also see a visible gap in the spring or notice the spring looks stretched or damaged. If you suspect a broken spring, don't try to open the door - call a professional immediately."},{question:"What's the difference between torsion and extension springs?",answer:"Torsion springs are mounted above the door on a metal bar and use torque to lift the door. They're typically more durable, last 7-10 years (about 10,000 cycles), provide smoother operation, and are safer if they fail. Extension springs are mounted on either side of the door and stretch as the door closes. They're less expensive but typically last 5-7 years. Our technicians can determine which type your door uses and recommend the best replacement option based on your specific needs."},{question:"Is it dangerous to replace garage door springs myself?",answer:"Yes, replacing garage door springs is extremely dangerous and should NEVER be attempted by homeowners. Springs are under extreme tension (hundreds of pounds) and can cause serious injury or death if mishandled. The spring can snap with tremendous force, causing severe cuts, broken bones, or worse. Always hire a licensed, experienced professional with proper tools, training, and safety equipment."},{question:`How quickly can you replace broken springs in ${n}?`,answer:"We offer same-day garage door spring replacement service throughout NY, NJ & CT. Most spring replacements can be completed within 1-2 hours of arrival. We stock common spring sizes in our service vehicles, so repairs can often be completed on the first visit without additional trips. Emergency spring replacement is available 24/7."},{question:"How long do new garage door springs last?",answer:"Torsion springs typically last 7-10 years (about 10,000 cycles), while extension springs last 5-7 years (about 10,000 cycles). Lifespan depends on usage frequency, door weight, spring quality, and maintenance. We use high-quality springs from trusted manufacturers and provide maintenance tips to extend their lifespan. Regular lubrication and balance checks can help prolong spring life."},{question:"Should I replace both springs even if only one is broken?",answer:"If you have a two-spring system, yes, you should replace both springs even if only one is broken. Springs age together and wear at similar rates, so if one breaks, the other is likely to fail soon. Replacing both ensures balanced operation, prevents another emergency repair, and extends the overall lifespan. We can discuss this during our estimate and explain the benefits."},{question:"What brands of springs do you use for replacement?",answer:"We use high-quality springs from trusted manufacturers including LiftMaster, Chamberlain, and other industry-leading brands. We match the spring specifications to your door's weight and size to ensure proper operation. All springs come with a manufacturer warranty, and our installation work is backed by our service warranty."},{question:"Do you offer warranty on spring replacement?",answer:"Yes, all our spring replacements come with a comprehensive warranty. Parts (springs) are typically covered for 1-2 years depending on the manufacturer, and our labor is covered for 90 days to 1 year. We stand behind our workmanship and will return to fix any issues related to our installation at no additional charge."},{question:"What areas do you serve for spring replacement services?",answer:"We provide garage door spring replacement services throughout New York (including Queens, Brooklyn, Long Island, Westchester County), New Jersey (Bergen County), and Connecticut (Fairfield County). We serve all areas within a 50-mile radius and offer same-day service in most locations."},{question:"Can you replace springs on any brand of garage door?",answer:"Yes, we can replace springs on all major garage door brands including Clopay, Wayne Dalton, Amarr, Raynor, CHI, LiftMaster, Chamberlain, and more. Our technicians are trained on all types of spring systems and can source the correct replacement springs for your specific door model and size."},{question:"What should I do if my garage door spring breaks?",answer:"First, do NOT attempt to open or close the door manually - this is dangerous. Secure the door in its current position if possible, and immediately call a professional. Keep children and pets away from the garage. We offer 24/7 emergency spring replacement service and can typically have a technician to you within 60-90 minutes. Don't delay - a broken spring can lead to further damage to other components."},{question:"How do I maintain my garage door springs to extend their life?",answer:"Regular maintenance can extend spring life significantly. Have your springs professionally inspected and lubricated annually. Avoid excessive opening and closing, and ensure the door is properly balanced. Keep the door tracks clean and aligned, and address any issues with cables or rollers promptly. We offer maintenance plans that include spring inspections and lubrication."},{question:"Are there different quality levels of springs?",answer:"Yes, spring quality varies by manufacturer and materials used. We use high-quality, industry-grade springs from trusted manufacturers. While lower-quality springs may be cheaper initially, they fail more frequently and can cause damage to other components. Investing in quality springs saves money in the long run through longer lifespan and fewer repairs."},{question:"Can weather affect garage door springs?",answer:"Yes, extreme temperature changes, humidity, and weather conditions can affect spring lifespan and performance. Springs can become more brittle in extreme cold and may experience increased wear in hot, humid conditions. Regular maintenance and proper lubrication help protect springs from weather-related damage. We can provide weather-specific maintenance recommendations for your area."}],d=async s=>{s.preventDefault();const r=new FormData(s.currentTarget),l=new URLSearchParams;for(const[a,m]of r.entries())l.append(a,m.toString());try{(await fetch("https://readdy.ai/api/form/d413rd22kqgi5a0pu880",{method:"POST",headers:{"Content-Type":"application/x-www-form-urlencoded"},body:l})).ok?(alert("Spring replacement request submitted!
